## Planning
To start planning the layout of the website, I first made wireframes. I visualized what I wanted all the functions to be and created the user stories below . Then after setting up the API I tested the applicaiton with curl scripts and starting building out the front end application by each component. 


# User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to sign up/in/out and change password.
As a user, I want to be able to add wishes to my list.
As a user, I want to be able to update and delete my wishes. 
As a user, I want to view my latest wish at the top of the list.
